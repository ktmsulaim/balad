                        We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on their servers. The
                        data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing
                        payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase
                        transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.
                        Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
                        Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
                        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its
                        service providers.
